Jackson Special Agent in Charge IRS Criminal Investigation Washington D.C. Field Office. “Today’s sentencing is a reminder that IRS-CI will remain vigilant in our investigation of these crimes and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to combat this type of criminal conduct.”According to his plea agreement from November 2013 through June 2017 Farace purchased narcotics manufacturing equipment including pill presses and counterfeit “Xanax” pill molds which he used to press loose alprazolam powder into tablet or pill form to resemble genuine Xanax pills.  Farace solicited orders for the alprazolam pills on dark web marketplaces and sold alprazolam pills directly to buyers in exchange for Bitcoin.The dark web is the part of the World Wide Web that requires specific software configurations or authorization to access allowing users and website operators to remain anonymous.  Dark web marketplaces typically use Bitcoin or other digital currency as the means of payment for their transactions.Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that does not exist in any physical form.  It is not issued or controlled by any government bank or company but is generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.  Bitcoin can be exchanged for conventional currency with the exchange rate determined on the open market.Farace admitted that he communicated with his customers through encrypted electronic messages and shipped the completed pill orders through the U.S. mail.  Farace admitted that the postage for these packages was usually paid using pre-paid debit cards that Farace obtained in the names of and with the personal identifying information of other people.  Law enforcement also recovered fake driver’s licenses in the names of those individuals one bearing Farace’s photograph when they executed a federal search warrant at Farace’s home on January 16 2018.  Based on data recovered from dark web marketplaces seized by law enforcement Farace distributed more than 920000 alprazolam pills between December 2013 and March 2017.From at least July 2015 until February 2017 Farace and Swain conspired with others to launder the proceeds of the illegal drug sales by conducting financial transactions designed to conceal and disguise the nature source ownership and control of the illegal drug proceeds.   Specifically Farace used pseudonyms to contact a co-conspirator through dark web marketplaces and encrypted messages in order to exchange Bitcoin he received from his drug trafficking for cash.  The co-conspirator would then mail or ship packages of U.S. currency equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin received less a fee to mailing addresses provided by Farace.  To conceal the fact that he was receiving cash Farace and later Swain opened post office boxes at U.S. Post Offices and private rental mailboxes in fake names.  Swain knew that Farace was receiving cash and drugs at these mailboxes and that the cash was the proceeds of Farace’s drug trafficking.  During the course of the conspiracy Farace received cash totaling more than $5 million through the mails which he had exchanged for Bitcoin earned from drug trafficking.  In addition Farace and Swain drove to New Jersey so that Swain could collect $200000 in cash that Farace had exchanged for Bitcoin.  During the in-person meeting on February 16 2017 Swain provided a fictitious name to the individual he met and falsely stated that the Bitcoin and cash were his own.  Farace and Swain later tried unsuccessfully to exchange Bitcoin for $400000 in cash with the same individual.United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the DEA HSI the U.S. Postal Inspection Service the IRS-Criminal Investigation; the U.S. Marshals Service and the Baltimore County Baltimore City Howard and Anne Arundel County Police Departments for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dana J.
